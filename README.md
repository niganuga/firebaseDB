Project Overview

firebaseDB is a Firebase project integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). It stores and manages data for Transfer Superstars, supporting content retrieval, internal tools, and AI-based automation. The project leverages Firebase Hosting, Firestore, and Cloud Storage for efficient data handling.

Features

	â€¢	Automated Deployments: GitHub Actions automate the build and deployment process to Firebase Hosting.
	â€¢	Secure Token Management: Uses GitHub Secrets to store API keys and access tokens securely.
	â€¢	Content Retrieval: Supports AI-powered semantic search for quick and efficient data access.
	â€¢	Local Development: Firebase Emulator Suite for local testing and development.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

	â€¢	Node.js (v18 or higher)
	â€¢	Firebase CLI installed globally:

npm install -g firebase-tools


	â€¢	GitHub Account with OAuth permissions for Firebase CLI.

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/niganuga/firebaseDB.git
cd firebaseDB


	2.	Log in to Firebase:

firebase login


	3.	Initialize Firebase project:

firebase init hosting

	â€¢	.github/workflows/: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.
	â€¢	public/: Contains static files for Firebase Hosting.
	â€¢	sync_to_dropbox.py: Python script for syncing files to Dropbox.
	â€¢	firebase.json: Firebase configuration file.
	â€¢	.firebaserc: Firebase project alias configuration.

Configuration and Secrets

Store sensitive data in GitHub Secrets:
	â€¢	FIREBASE_TOKEN: Token for Firebase CLI deployments.
	â€¢	DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN: Token for Dropbox API access.

Accessing Secrets in Code

In Python (sync_to_dropbox.py):

import os

DROPBOX_TOKEN = os.getenv("DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN")
FIREBASE_TOKEN = os.getenv("FIREBASE_TOKEN")

In Node.js:

const dropboxToken = process.env.DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN;
const firebaseToken = process.env.FIREBASE_TOKEN;

Local Development and Testing

Use Firebase Emulator Suite for local testing:

firebase emulators:start

Access the local site at: http://localhost:5000

Deployment

	1.	Add and commit changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"


	2.	Push changes to main branch:

git push origin main



The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy the updates to Firebase Hosting.

Usage and Automation

	â€¢	File Syncing: sync_to_dropbox.py automatically syncs files to Dropbox using the access token stored in GitHub Secrets.
	â€¢	Semantic Search: The project supports AI-based content retrieval, making it easy to search and access digital assets, metadata, and knowledge base files.

Troubleshooting

Common Issues

	1.	Push Rejected Due to Secrets:
	â€¢	GitHub may block pushes if secrets are detected. Use git filter-repo to remove sensitive data from history:

git filter-repo --path sync_to_dropbox.py --invert-paths
git push origin main --force


	2.	Deployment Fails:
	â€¢	Check GitHub Actions logs in the Actions tab for detailed error messages.
	3.	Local Testing Issues:
	â€¢	Ensure Firebase Emulator is running:

firebase emulators:start
